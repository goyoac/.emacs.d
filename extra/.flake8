# Configuring the syntax checker (flake8)
# elpy uses flake8 for syntax checking. This is a wrapper around pep8, PyFlake and Ned Batchelderâ€™s McCabe script. You can change the flake8 settings globally by editing its config file. For windows the filename is ~/.flake8 and all other operating systems it is ~/.config/flake8. The flake8 config options are located in the flake8 docs here.

# As an example, you can change the max default line length from 79 to 99 on linux by C-x C-f ~/.config/flake8 then edit the config file to be:

# The user settings are read from the ~/.config/flake8 file (or the ~/.flake8 file on Windows). Example:

# elpy documentation on subject: http://flake8.readthedocs.org/en/latest/config.html#global

# pep 8 error codes: http://pep8.readthedocs.org/en/latest/intro.html#error-codes
