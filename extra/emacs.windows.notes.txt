;;; IF EMACS CRASHES ON EXIT.  LIKELY IT'S FINDING A LINKED C LIBRARY THAT'S INCOMPATIBLE WITH ITS NEEDS.  THIS CAN HAPPEN IS SOMETHING LIKE C:\MINGW\BIN IS IN PATH.
;; A common cause is ZLib: zlib1.dll.  If this is the case, download the 64bit compiled ver from: http://www.zlib.net/ and place it in the $EMACS_HOME\bin dir.  Make sure that $EMACS_HOME\bin is in the $PATH before any other MinGW dirs that might have zlib.

;;; TO MAKE EMACS START IN HOME (%PROFILE%) DIR BY DEFAULT:
1. pin a shortcut to runemacs to taskbar
2. edit its properties and set "start in" to %USERPROFILE%

;;; RUBY WITH PRY
see $EMACS_HOME/extra/.pryrc.  There's a problem with Readline in Windows not working with emacs.  Place the contents of this .pryrc into your ~/.pryrc to monkey patch and configure a good experience for windows.

- possible enhancement - might want to make the ruby code in .pryrc only run if it detects its inside emacs.  see .pryrc for how.

;; winpython specific setup:

;; ipython has now changed to jupyter.  make sure that you've installed it:


  (setq python-shell-interpreter-args "-i C:\\WinPython-64bit-2.7.9.3\\python-2.7.9.amd64\\Scripts\\ipython.exe console")
  pip install epc
  pip install pyreadline


  pip install --upgrade jupyter

  to use matplotlib, use "import pylab" at top of script with plots.

  pylab can be added into ipython repl directly by typing: %pylab at prompt. 


  example from init.el:

  (if (or (eq system-type 'ms-dos) (eq system-type 'windows-nt))
    (setq
     python-shell-interpreter "C:\\WinPython-64bit-2.7.9.3\\python-2.7.9.amd64\\python.exe"
     python-shell-interpreter-args "-i C:\\WinPython-64bit-2.7.9.3\\python-2.7.9.amd64\\Scripts\\ipython.exe console"

;; CYGWIN SLOW BASH STARTUP TIME
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28507014/cygwin-commands-from-cmd-are-slow-from-bash-are-fast/28608622#28608622

A section in Cygwin's FAQ addresses slow startup times. Cygwin recently changed to using Active Directory lookups for authentication, rather than using flat files. Changing the defaults in /etc/nsswitch.conf from

passwd:   files db
group:    files db
to

passwd:   files
group:    files
skips the AD lookup. My Cygwin commands are now speedy again.
