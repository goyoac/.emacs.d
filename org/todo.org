*** images and links (both relative and external)

** provide access to org-mode reference card in documentation

http://orgmode.org/orgcard.txt
** connect emacs buffer to javascript or clojurescipt fe

live coding reflected in realtime
possible node eng
see jupyter notebooks with jupyter server connected to remotely through ein for inspiration
live hacking experience
play surface
serious collaborative shared process with multiple attached buffers
not repl, buffer
research slime experience and how it achieves
** lisp matrix math

check scheme
clojure

*** spreadsheet as an i/o surface and hookup cell, row, and column through fn pipelining 

read published paper and get code

** d3 ast visualization of normal human lanuage

pattern identification

suskind how to think about what is and how works
reality cascade
capture whiteboard
evaluate from god's eye view

*** a lifetime is a point

evaluate to innermost
emmergent causality backward cascade

*** church thesis

*** scoping and bounding

a life time of closing over the state of previous experience (state)
the notion of environment (initial state)
feedback of execution changing environment (its not static)

*** many lifetimes many points

interacitivy between points

*** the meaning of time

the flow of execution
change is evidence of time and evident

*** similation and similacra

here
now

** the meaning of let

let there be
invoke into existence
permit to exist (to be and be in such a way)
the prime keyword of all existence
god spoke everything into existence
