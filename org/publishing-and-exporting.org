Org-mode offers a command to produce a PDF file from the LaTeX
export. This is bound to C-c C-e p. The command C-c C-e d does all
this and opens the PDF file in the default reader.

I find that C-C C-e brings up export menu.  Then I choose:

C-c C-e l p to create a pdf from the org-document

or

C-c C-e l o to create a pdf from the org document and open it

- i have defined "org-site" in ~/.emacs.d/customization/setup-orgmode.el

- other websites can be defined there.

- to publish the website:

  do: M-x org-publish
  then: org-site (that's the name of that I gave the site)
