How to setup Emacs, Putty, Tmux, and Bash for Great Goodness

* Emacs

** Keys
Putty Keymap

** wind move
default keys

* Terminal
** Emacs Themes
In order for them to work fully and properly, set 
**  Terminal setup
export TERM=xterm-256color
** Kitty
Fixes control key characters

1:
Don't use stock putty.  It doesn't send proper xterm-keys, so you're emacs binding won't be recognized properly anyway.
Instead, use kitty, which fixes the key issues.  Its a fork of current putty with improvements.

2:
make a ~/.tmux.conf file

put this in it:

#set-window-option -g xterm-keys on
set -g xterm-keys on
set -g default-terminal "xterm-256color"
set -g terminal-overrides "xterm*:kLFT2=\eOD:kRIT2=\eOC:kUP2=\eOA:kDN2=\eOB:smkx@:rmkx@"

Now, everything will behave as normal through terminal sessions.

*** you may want to remap C-x C-b in tmux because its a key from emacs
